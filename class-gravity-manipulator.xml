			<p>You can spend mana points to create a gravitational anomaly. Your save dc for these abilities is equal to 8 + your wisdom modifier + your proficency bonus.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a reaction you can spend mana points to slow the fall of up to five creatures within 60 feet of you. Each creature selected costs 1 mana point. A falling creature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until 1 minute passes. If the creature lands before the effect ends, it takes no falling damage and can land on its feet, and the effect ends for that creature.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action you can spend 1 mana point to increase the gravity in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you can see within 60 feet of you. Each creature in the sphere on the turn when you cast the spell must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 force damage, and its speed is halved until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and suffers no reduction to its speed.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action you can spend 3 mana points to choose a willing creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. For 1 minute, the target’s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its turns.</p>
			<p class="indent">As an action you can spend 3 mana points to create a gravitational vacuum, unleash it in a 30-foot cone, and decide whether the it pulls or pushes creatures and objects. Each creature in that cone must make a Constitution saving throw. A creature takes 6d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. And every creature that fails the save is either pulled 15 feet toward you or pushed 15 feet away from you, depending on the choice you made for the ability.</p>
